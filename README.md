# Blockchain-and-AI-based-EV-Optimal-Scheduling-At-Charging-Station

 The project develops a predictive model using machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, LGBM, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting)
 to optimize the scheduling of electric vehicle (EV) charging times, integrating blockchain for secure data management. Key performance
 metrics include Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), ensuring efficient and fair allocation of charging resources.
